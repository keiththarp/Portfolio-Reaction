        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><b>Full-stack web developer</b> building on my marketing and entrepreneurial background to
        create enjoyable web experiences.</p>
        <p>As a developer I enjoy combining the creativity and problem solving that I bring from my past careers into
        real solutions for clients and internet users.
        I've worked in several great groups within all aspects of app development and recently completed a media app
        that helps users log and save their media consumption.
        Using API queries from multiple sources we save and display a user's selection in a cleanly designed single
        page app.</p>
